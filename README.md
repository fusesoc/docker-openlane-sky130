# OpenLANE + SkyWater 130 PDK docker image

This repository contains the recipe for building docker images that combine the [eFabless OpenLANE](https://github.com/efabless/openlane) Docker image with a pre-built [SkyWater 130 nm PDK](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk). The purpose is to save users from manually dealing with the PDK and make sure the OpenLANE version and the PDK stay in sync.

Improvements and suggestions are very welcome.
